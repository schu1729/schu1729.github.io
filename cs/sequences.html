<h2 class="section">What is a sequence?</h2>
<div class='main'>
	<div class="def"><div class="def_head">Sequence</div><p class="def">A <em>sequence</em>, $a_n$ (or sometimes, $\{a_n\})$, is a list of numbers indexed by the counting numbers usually starting at 0, but sometimes starting at 1.
	</div>
 	<p>There are various ways to describe our sequence $a_n$. We can enumerate the first few terms of the sequence and ask the reader to continue the pattern: $a_n=\{0,2,4,6,8,10,12,\ldots\}$, or we can give an explicit rule, or <em>general term</em> for calculating the terms of the sequence: $a_n=2n$. The latter description is sometimes called a <em>closed form</em> of the sequence. If we want to talk about the 12th term of the sequence we would refer to it as $a_{12}$.
	<div class ="ex">

		What are the potential dangers of specifying a sequence by enumerating a few terms and then using $\ldots$?
	</div>
	<div class ="ex">
		<img class="ex" src="icons/gears3.svg">
		Can you think of a sequence of numbers with a well-define pattern that may not have a general term?
	</div>
	<div class='ex'><img class'ex' src='icons/book135.svg'>Let's take a look at a few more examples of sequences. As we examine the following sequence, try to generate a general term for the sequence and use it to find the tenth term of each sequence.
		<ul>
			<li>The odd numbers $O_n=\{1,3,5,7,9,11,\ldots\}$ are a sequence.</li>
			<li>The multiples of five $f_n=\{5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,\dots\}$</li>
			<li>The powers of two $b_n=\{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,\ldots\}$</li>	
			<li>The primes $p_n=\{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,\ldots\}$</li>
			<li>An alternating sequence $x_n=\{1,-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{16},-\frac{1}{32},\ldots\}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>
		What is the general term for each of the above sequences? What is the value of the tenth term? <button class='hint' id='one'>check</button>
		<div class='ans' id='onea'>
			<ul>
				<li>$O_n=2n-1$ where $n$ starts at 1, so $O_{10}=19$.</li>
				<li>$f_n=5n$ again starting with $n=1$, so $f_{10}=50$</li>
				<li>$b_n=2^{n-1}$ starting with $n=1$, so $b_{10}=512$</li>
				<li>I don't know a closed form for $p_n$, but $p_{10}=29$</li>
				<li>$x_n=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ so $x_{10}=-1/512$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Even when it is clear what the pattern of a sequence is, there still may not be a unique general term that describes the sequence, or the general term is difficult to determine. 
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>Given the sequence $x_n=\{1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,\ldots\}$, what are two possible closed forms for this sequence? <button class='hint' id='two'>check</button>
		<div class='ans' id='twoa'>$x_n=(-1)^{n+1}$ or $x_n=-\cos(\pi n)$.</div>
	</div>
	<p>The advantage of knowing the general term is the ease with which we can find terms of the sequence. If we were asked what the 233rd odd number is we can just use the sequence $O_n=2n-1$, and see that $O_{233}=466-1=465$.
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>
		Use the sequence $h_n=\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}$ to determine how many meters long a meter that is cut in half 11 times is. <button class='hint' id='three'>check</button>
			<div class='ans' id='threea'>Since $h_n$ gives the length of something halved $n$ times. We just find the 11th term of the sequence. $h_11=\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{11}=\dfrac{1}{2048}$. So it is $\dfrac{1}{2048}$ meters long.</div>

	There are some good reasons to adopt this notation. Previously we would think of $y=3x$ and $y=x^2+\sqrt{x}$ as adequate notation for functions.

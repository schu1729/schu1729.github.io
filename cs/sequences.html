<h2 class="section">What is a sequence?</h2>
<div class='main'>
	<div class="def"><div class="def_head">Sequence</div><p class="def">A <em>sequence</em>, $a_n$ (or sometimes, $\{a_n\})$, is a list of numbers indexed by the counting numbers usually starting at 0, but sometimes starting at 1.
	</div>
 	<p>There are various ways to describe our sequence $a_n$. We can enumerate the first few terms of the sequence and ask the reader to continue the pattern: $a_n=\{0,2,4,6,8,10,12,\ldots\}$, or we can give an explicit rule, or <em>general term</em> for calculating the terms of the sequence: $a_n=2n$. The latter description is sometimes called a <em>closed form</em> of the sequence. If we want to talk about the 12th term of the sequence we would refer to it as $a_{12}$.
	<div class ="ex">

		What are the potential dangers of specifying a sequence by enumerating a few terms and then using $\ldots$?
	</div>
	<div class ="ex">
		<img class="ex" src="icons/gears3.svg">
		Can you think of a sequence of numbers with a well-defined pattern that may not have a general term?
	</div>
	<div class='ex'><img class'ex' src='icons/book135.svg'>Let's take a look at a few more examples of sequences. As we examine the following sequence, try to generate a general term for the sequence and use it to find the tenth term of each sequence.
		<ul>
			<li>The odd numbers $O_n=\{1,3,5,7,9,11,\ldots\}$ are a sequence.</li>
			<li>The multiples of five $f_n=\{5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,\dots\}$</li>
			<li>The powers of two $b_n=\{1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,\ldots\}$</li>	
			<li>The primes $p_n=\{2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,\ldots\}$</li>
			<li>An alternating sequence $x_n=\{1,-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{16},-\frac{1}{32},\ldots\}$</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>
		What is the general term for each of the above sequences? What is the value of the tenth term? <button class='hint' id='one'>check</button>
		<div class='ans' id='onea'>
			<ul>
				<li>$O_n=2n-1$ where $n$ starts at 1, so $O_{10}=19$.</li>
				<li>$f_n=5n$ again starting with $n=1$, so $f_{10}=50$</li>
				<li>$b_n=2^{n-1}$ starting with $n=1$, so $b_{10}=512$</li>
				<li>I don't know a closed form for $p_n$, but $p_{10}=29$</li>
				<li>$x_n=(-1)^{n-1}\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$ so $x_{10}=-1/512$</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>Even when it is clear what the pattern of a sequence is, there still may not be a unique general term that describes the sequence, or the general term is difficult to determine. 
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>Given the sequence $x_n=\{1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,1,-1,\ldots\}$, what are two possible closed forms for this sequence? <button class='hint' id='two'>check</button>
		<div class='ans' id='twoa'>$x_n=(-1)^{n+1}$ or $x_n=-\cos(\pi n)$.</div>
	</div>
	<p>The advantage of knowing the general term is the ease with which we can find terms of the sequence. If we were asked what the 233rd odd number is we can just use the sequence $O_n=2n-1$, and see that $O_{233}=466-1=465$.
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'>
		Use the sequence $h_n=\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}$ to determine how many meters long a meter that is cut in half 11 times is. <button class='hint' id='three'>check</button>
			<div class='ans' id='threea'>Since $h_n$ gives the length of something halved $n$ times. We just find the 11th term of the sequence. $h_11=\left(\dfrac{1}{2}\right)^{11}=\dfrac{1}{2048}$. So it is $\dfrac{1}{2048}$ meters long.</div>
	</div>
</div>

<h2 class='section'>Recursively Defined Sequences</h2>
<div class='main'>
	<p>Another method by which you can specify a sequence is by giving a rule that relies on previous terms of the sequence to generate the next term of the sequence. The classic example is the Fibonacci sequence.
	<div class='ex'><img class'ex' src='icons/book135.svg'>
		The Fibonacci sequence begins: $\{1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,\ldots\}$. We can define it recursively by defining the nth term as the sum of the two previous terms. In notation: $f_n=f_{n-1}+f_{n-2}$, but we also need to then specify how the sequence starts, $f_1=1$ and $f_2=1$.
	</div>
	<p>Using a recursive description of a sequence is sometimes easier than finding a general term. Try to determine the general term of the Fibonacci sequence. It is difficult. Also, not all sequences have a general term. However, a large drawback to using recursively defined sequences is that usually to determine a term in the sequence you will need to have generated all the previous terms as well. Easy for a computer, but tedious for most of us.
	<div class='ex'><img class='ex' src='icons/gears3.svg'> Let $a_n=2a_{n-1}^2-2$ and $a_1=2$. Find the fourth term of the sequence. <button class='hint' id='four'>check</button>
		<div class='ans' id='foura'>$a_2=6$, $a_3=70$, $a_4=9,798$.</div>

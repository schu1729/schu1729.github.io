<h2>Percent change in value over time</h2>
<p> If you invest 1,000 in a bank savings account that pays you 5% interest at the end of each year, it turns out that an exponential function can be used to model the value of your investment over time. Let's see how:
	<p>After one year, you have the original 1,000 and interest of 1,000(0.05). For the second year you will be earning 5% interest not on 1,000, but on 1,000(1.05). This effect of earning interest on interest is called compounding. Each year your investment grows by 5% so we can model its value with the function $S(t)=1000(1.05)^t$.
		
	<p> Unfortunately many large assets such as cars lose value over time, this is called depreciation. If you bought a car for 10,000 and it depreciates by 10% every year we can model this with the function $D(t)=10,000(0.9)^t$.

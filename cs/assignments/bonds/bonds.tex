\begin{enumerate}
	\item You buy a 15 year bond for \$10,000, and it pays a coupon of 5\% annually.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Find the present value of the future cash flows of the bond assuming a discount rate of 4.5\%. 
			\item What if the discount rate is 4.4\%? 
			\item What if the discount rate is 4.6\%?
			\item How can you describe how sensitive the present value of the cash flow is to interest rates?
		\end{enumerate}
	\item If you receive 10 payments of \$10,000 at the end of each year for the next decade, what is the present value of this cash flow assuming a discount rate of 3\%?
	\item If you receive 10 payments of \$10,000 at the  end of each year, but the payments only start 5 years from now, find the present value of this cash flow assuming a discount of 3\%.
	\item If you receive \$1000 every year forever, what is the present value of this stream of income assuming a discount of 3\%?
\end{enumerate}

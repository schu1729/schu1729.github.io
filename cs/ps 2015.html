<!--Tests were take home for the first year, but there will probably be in-class components to the tests going forward. 
-->

<h3 class="section">Tests</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="tests/cs_test1/cs_test1.pdf">test 1</a>. Please remember to save the graphs and work you do in fathom. Save the fathom file as "test1_yourName.ftm" and submit it with the test.</li>
		<ul>
			<li> <a href= "tests/cs_test1/data_test1.ftm">data set for test 1</a></li>
		</ul>
		<li><a href="tests/cs_test2/cs_test2.pdf">test 2</a> Please remember to read the directions carefully, and just be sure to check that any models you write down actually make sense with the data(points) you know.</li>
		<li><a href="tests/cs_test3/cs_test3.pdf">test 3</a> Good Luck. You can spend at most 1 hour plus or minus a few minutes. Please write out the honesty pledge and sign on the back of the last page.</li>
		<li><a href="tests/cs_test4/cs_test4.pdf">test 4</a> Good luck. Also, a reminder to show all work. Particularly since much of it is done in the calculator, make sure to write down the expressions so that if you make a calculator mistake you still earn most of the credit for the problem. The test is due next Friday, May 15th.
		<li> Last <a href="tests/cs_test5/cs_test5.pdf">test<a/>. Due Monday 6/8 at the latest. </li>

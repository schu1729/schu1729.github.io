\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $f(x)=10(2)^x$
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Give the domain and range of $f$.\\[2cm]
			\item Give a rough sketch of $f$, labeling salient features.\\[4cm]
		\end{enumerate}
		
	\item Assuming $g(x)$ is an exponential of the form $y=ab^x$ that passes through the points $(2,50)$ and $(4,12.5)$, find the equation of $g(x)$.\\[3cm]
	\item If you deposit 100 dollars at a bank, how much money will you have at the end of the following situations:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Your money is compounded annually at 5\% for 5 years.\\[4cm]
			\item Your money is compounded monthly at 5\% for 5 years.\\[3cm]
			\item Your money is compounded continuously at 5\% for 5 years.\\[3cm]
			
		\end{enumerate}
	\item If over 10 years your money has doubled, what is your effective annual growth rate for each of those years?\\[3cm]
	\item What is the effective annual decay rate of the function $f(t)=100e^{-0.25t}$?\\[2cm]
	\item Give a sketch of the following two functions on the same set of axes. $f(x)=10(1.05)^x$ and $g(x)=1.5(f(-x))-4$.			  			
\end{enumerate}
